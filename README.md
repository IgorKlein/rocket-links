# About 💡
This simple website was developed along the Discover Marathon week, an event promoted by Rockeatseat tech school. This project aims to act as a link concentrator that can be used anywhere.

# Motivation 💪
As we know, there are a lot of websites with profile pages that offer the limitation of only one url for each registration made. 

In this case, this project can be very useful, because the owner can add a larger number of personal addresses in just one url.

# Advantages ⬆️
We also know that there are several similar services available on the Internet, some of them are free of charges. However, we believe that using a self-made solution brings more security to our application and the possibility of expand features even further.

# User Stories 🪄
- User can access any link by clicking on the desired button.
- User can change the theme of the application by clicking on the profile photo.
